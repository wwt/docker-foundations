# Visual Studio Code Development Environment Review

The goal of this walk-through was to expose you to the integrations with simple examples.  This section validates the environment is ready for use.

## Python Integration

In this section you will create a simple Python script to retrieve search results from iTunes.  You are looking to validate the Python functionality within the Visual Studio Code Editor.

:worried: Don't worry, you don't have to know any Python at this point...

1. *CREATE* a **file** named `search_itunes.py`
2. *PASTE* the Python code below

    ```python
    import sys
    import requests

    # CONSTANTS
    BASE_URL = "https://itunes.apple.com/search?country=US"
    MEDIA = ['movie', 'music', 'podcast']

    # INPUT VARIABLES
    media = input("What type of media? [movie, music, or podcast]:  ").lower()

    # VALIDATE INPUT
    if media not in MEDIA:
        print(f"Please type one of the valid options [{MEDIA}]")
        sys.exit()

    term = input("Enter search string:  ").lower()

    # INTERNAL VARIABLES
    _url = f"{BASE_URL}&media={media}&term={term}"
    _session = requests.session()

    # MAKE REST API CALL
    results = _session.get(_url)

    # EXTRACT RESULT DATA FROM RESONSE OBJECT
    data = results.json()['results']

    # LOOP OVER RESULTS AND PRINT
    for result in data:
        print(f"{result['trackName']:<50}{result['releaseDate']:>50}")


    ```

3. *SAVE* the **file**

4. *CLICK* the green play button

   [![Run Python](../images/run-python.png "Run Python")](../../images/run-python.png){target=_blank}

5. *ANSWER* the prompts

6. *REVIEW* the results

The presence of the **green** play button indicates the Python extension is working.

You can also see the Python Debugger on the left, the 4th icon down.
