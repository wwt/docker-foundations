# Wrap up

The goal of this walk-through was to provide you real-world, hands-on exposure to building a Docker image. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what you can with Docker and Dockerfiles. You can take these same steps for you future projects and modify where needed to meet the needs of the project.

:tada: Congratulations on building your first Dockerfile and integrating it with Visual Studio Code.

The source repository for this page can be accessed by clicking the [**wwt/docker-foundations**](https://github.com/wwt/docker-foundations).

In the source repository there is additional information and a very detailed PowerPoint presentation you can use as a reference.
