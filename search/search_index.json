Scenario: Imagine you want to start a new Python-based development project and need to get your development environment setup and ready. Quote A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession. A Dockerfile defines how an image is built. Once built, the Docker image is the blueprint that will be used to instantiate an ephemeral instance called a container. Selecting a Base Image Typically, the image that you will build for your projects will be based on a foundational image someone else created. There are a significant number of existing images that you can use as the base of your image. The best approach is to visit Docker Hub and see what images are available based on the focus on your project. Scenario: Your project is Python-based, so the base image will be one of the available Python images. There are very simple filtering and searching capabilities on Docker Hub that make it easy to quickly narrow down the options for your base image. NAVIGATE to https://hub.docker.com CLICK Explore CLICK Official Images CLICK Programming Languages CLICK Python Feel free to review the available images and read the supporting documentation about the images. This example will utilize a Python base image named slim-buster . Info Here are some instructions for building a base image if you so desire: Base Images Create the Initial Dockerfile Once you have selected the desired base image you can start to build your Dockerfile for the project. The first line of a Dockerfile is almost always the FROM command. The only other command that can precede FROM is ARG . This section keeps it simple and uses only FROM CREATE a new file named Dockerfile in the root of your project directory ADD the following first line \u200b FROM python:slim-buster Providing Meta Data Using the LABEL command we can include some information about the Dockerfile to increase supportability down the road. The LABEL command allows you to define a series of key and value pairs of attributes. # Define some meta data LABEL author = \"Jeff Andiorio\" email = \"jeff.andiorio@wwt.com\" Installing OS Requirements There will be many occasions where you will need to add some OS level packages that rely on a package manager for installation. In this case we are on a Debian Linux based system which uses apt as a package manager. In the Dockerfile you can use the RUN command to provide instructions to perform these package installations. The RUN instruction can be used for executing commands on the target container. This section will use the shell syntax. Check the Docker documentation for more information. # Update Debian Packages and Install Git RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install git Since this will be our development environment we will need to have git installed in the container. Create a Working Directory A Working Directory is set to be the source directory for all subsequent RUN , CMD , COPY , and ADD Dockerfile Instructions. This walk-through will create a /development directory in our container and set it as our working directory Tip If the directory doesn't exist it will be created automatically. APPEND the WORKDIR instruction to the Dockerfile # Set the new directory WORKDIR /development Copy Files Another common need is to copy files into the container. When using the container as a development environment, Visual Studio Code will automatically mount the project directory and make the files available within the container. This relates to files you need to have available in the Docker image (aside from your development repo) like the requirements.txt file, so we can install packages. Scenario: The python project will require a couple of additional python packages. Create a requirements.txt file and make sure it's available to your Docker image. CREATE a file named requirements.txt in the project root directory ADD the text below to the file pyaml requests flake8 SAVE the file APPEND the COPY instruction to the Dockerfile # Copy requirements.txt into Container COPY requirements.txt /development Installing Python Requirements Scenario: Just having the requirements.txt file will not install the required packages. Add the 'RUN' command to the Dockerfile to install your python project requirements. APPEND the RUN instruction to the Dockerfile to install the python requirements # Install Python Requirements RUN pip install -r requirements.txt Info The 'RUN' command above will look for the requirements.txt file in the WORKDIR which is where you copied the file. Final File If you have followed all the instructions, your final Dockerfile will look similar to this: Tip The LABEL instruction will have your information. FROM python:slim-buster # Define some meta data LABEL author = \"Jeff Andiorio\" email = \"jeff.andiorio@wwt.com\" # Update Debian Packages and Install Git RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install git # Set the new directory WORKDIR /development # Copy requirements.txt into Container COPY requirements.txt /development # Install Python Requirements RUN pip install -r requirements.txt What's Next Now that you have the completed Dockerfile created and have successfully utilized several of the basic Dockerfile instructions how can you use that file?","title":"Create a Dockerfile"},{"location":"sections/section_3/#build-a-dockerfile","text":"This section will guide you through building a Dockerfile that will be used as part of the integration with Visual Studio Code.

Scenario: Integrate our Docker image into Visual Studio Code so we can take advantage of the seamless development environment and utilize feature like the Python Debugger and Integrated terminal. Brief Overview of VSC Integration The Visual Studio Code Remote - Container extension is one of the extensions included with the bundle we installed earlier. This extension allows you to use a container as your fully-integrated development environment, exposing all of the features of Visual Studio Code to you within it. There are multiple ways to utilize a container as your development environment within Visual Studio Code but we will look at the most integrated and automated method. Developing inside a Container Create a .devcontainer.json Config File When Visual Studio Code start it looks for a configuration file named .devcontainer.json located either at the project root or in a subfolder named .devcontainer . The existence of this file will prompt Visual Studio Code to use the contents of that configuration file to map your development environment to a container.
